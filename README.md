# mguiney resume
My personal LaTeX-generated resume, very WIP.

I sort of winged this and tried some weird stuff, both in terms of layout and in terms of sectioning, so bear with me, if you will.

The LaTeX I used is an adaptation of the template found here:\\
https://www.latextemplates.com/template/developer-cv

I liked the bold simplicity of it, but was not a fan of a lot of the more graphical aspects of the skills section, intro section, and lack of sidebar, so I switched it up. I may upload my fork of the template as soon as I get a few of the kinks ironed out of the formatting.
